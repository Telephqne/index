            <p>Alright, so for beginners, WiiuDisks (aka Kap) is not who she claims to be. She has secretly been a self-hating, bigoted KiwiFarmer, and there's an overwhelming amount of evidence to support this. I know this is a crazy claim to make without evidence, but as I delve further into this topic, I'll provide some.

Attached at the bottom of this Pastebin is a folder containing every referenced screenshot. I'll refer to them by their filenames for now, as I don't have a Google account that doesn't link back to me in real life to host them live.

To begin with, whenever a new account popped up (e.g., Virprkl, RealisticUnreal), Kap was always the first person to draw attention to it. This doesn’t seem unusual until you look into it further. Every time Artifyber allowed WiiuDisks into her SFW private vent accounts, those accounts always got leaked. However, when an account was created without WiiuDisks' access, it wouldn’t get leaked. I'll refer to the group of users involved here (Virprkl, RealisticUnreal, Mason, etc.) as "Group 1" for now.

In a screenshot shared by "Group 1," someone mentions Kap as the person they got the @ of Arti's private account from. I don’t have this screenshot myself, but the other investigator involved here (whose identity I’m unsure if they want to keep anonymous or not) does have it. This person has been trustworthy and has caught people like this on numerous occasions, so I’d say it's safe to believe them. Additionally, members of "Group 1" have mentioned that the person behind RealisticUnreal "might be" (this gets confirmed later) Kap herself. But we'll get into this later.

Now, more on "RealisticUnreal." Before the account turned into what it is now, it had a profile picture taken from the artist "Sr Wonder." At the time, Kap also had a profile picture drawn by this artist. This doesn't seem strange until you realize (as I'll show later) that RealisticUnreal and an old alt alias of Kap's are entirely linked. Since RealisticUnreal is confirmed to be Kap (with supporting screenshots in the folder), this makes it significantly worse for her, as she faked being over 18 on an alt account to gather dirt on people... weirdo. In the folder, you'll see screenshots of RealisticUnreal having the name of one of Kap's alternate aliases before it was changed to what it is today. I apologize if my English isn’t the best; I barely slept last night.

She has also leaked the private accounts of her other friends, backstabbed every one of her friends who weren’t on her private account, and manipulated and suicide-baited whenever called out.

Now, onto the actual accounts. The Discord account that was used to harass her partner on an alt was created around the same time as her main Discord account. The "RealisticUnreal" account links back to her old alias of "GreenMarioStar2." In the Twitter accounts folder, you'll see evidence of this. Not only that, but on "GreenMarioStar2"/"RealisticUnreal," you could see a screenshot of her desktop at one point on Internet Archive (saved as windows7.jpg). This was compared to a more recent photo of her desktop (windows10.png), and the two seemed to align almost perfectly—both American, both using Bandicam, and both with identical desktops. Feel free to investigate for yourself. https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://twitter.com/greenmariostar2

After the RealisticUnreal stuff was all said and done, the account was changed to have an... interesting name, possibly as a cover-up. This is seen in coverup.jpg. She also deleted all her threads on Roobi (who also sucks) after everything was said and done. They’ve had beef for the longest time, so it makes sense for her to do all of this and blame it on him. At the time, everyone hated him, so everyone would go along with it. Another thing worth noting is that WiiuDisks happens to have the exact same vocabulary, time zone, and dialect as RealisticUnreal, if that helps you believe this is actually happening (screenshots will be in the attached folder).

She has gone on to be manipulative towards her friends, suicide-baited countless times, and if these alts are indeed hers (which there is an abundance of evidence pointing towards), then she’s harassed her friends on alts. I have more proof of all of this (which wasn't included in this Pastebin). So, if she tries to respond and comes up with some lame excuse or fake dirt on me or the other investigator (who I've tried to keep anonymous for his own safety), she'd only be shooting herself in the foot.

Kap has always been a transphobic KiwiFarmer despite being transgender herself. Harassing her own boyfriend on an alt account is genuinely psychopathic behavior, and if all of this is true, then her suicide attempt caused by harassment must have been entirely faked.
